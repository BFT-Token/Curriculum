[{"uri":"https://EthBuilders.github.io/Curriculum/basics/git/basics/","title":"Basics","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The Basics When starting out with git, there really is only a few commands you need to know. For the purposes of this mini-tutorial I\u0026rsquo;m assuming you have a basic understanding of how to use a shell. I highly recommend you take a brief moment to refresh yourself, or do some mini-practice (Cheat Sheet).\nThe nine basic commands you\u0026rsquo;ll need to know are:\n git config  A convenience function that is used to set Git configuration values on a global or local project level   git clone  Clones a repository into a newly created directory   git checkout  Updates files in the working tree to match the version in the index or the specified tree  Don\u0026rsquo;t worry too much about knowing what the working tree, index, or staging are just yet, although you\u0026rsquo;re more than welcome to take a deep dive     git status  Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current HEAD commit   git add  This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree   git commit  Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message describing the changes   git merge  Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their histories diverged from the current branch) into the current branch   git pull  Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch   git push  Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to complete the given refs.    The best way to learn is through doing so follow along below to get up and running. The only requirements are that you have git, bash (or zsh/fish), a text editor, and internet.\nWalkthrough  Note: In the code blocks below user commands are denoted by the \u0026lsquo;$\u0026rsquo; prefacing the line. If a line is prefaced by a \u0026lsquo;#\u0026rsquo; it requires super user (root) access. Always take caution when running commands, especially those that require super user access, as they have the potential to damage your system.\nThe main take away: ALWAYS UNDERSTAND WHAT A COMMAND DOES BEFORE USING IT!\n Step 1: If you\u0026rsquo;ve never used git before you\u0026rsquo;ll have to do some setup. This is only necessary the first time you install git, afterwards you\u0026rsquo;ll be fine.\n$ git config --global user.name \u0026#39;[*Enter your name here*]\u0026#39; $ git config --global user.email \u0026#39;[*Enter your email here*]\u0026#39; Note: These commands setup your global identity when using git, when you work on a project it lets you and others keep track of what you did. Therefore your name and email will be available to anyone who can clone the repository.\nStep 2: Time to clone a repository, in our case we\u0026rsquo;ll just clone this one you\u0026rsquo;re reading from (how meta).\n$ git clone https://github.com/EthBuilders/Curriculum.git git-walkthrough $ cd git-walkthrough Congrats! You\u0026rsquo;re on your way, and now have officially cloned a repository.\nStep 3: Time to make sure you know how to move between branches.\nBranches in git, are kind of like separate \u0026hellip; well separate branches on a tree. Branches typically have the same roots, but they can go in separate directions and that\u0026rsquo;s okay. One key thing to remember when collaborating with others, and especially with git, is to keep your master/main branch ready and bug free. This means you should almost always work on a separate branch, and then combine your work when you are finished.\n$ git checkout -b new-branch # this command will only work if \u0026#39;new-branch\u0026#39; doesn\u0026#39;t exist, it creates a \u0026#39;new-branch\u0026#39; and then switches to it $ git checkout master # this switches back to the master branch $ git checkout new-branch # this switches back to the new-branch Step 4: Checking for changes is simple, and you should always constantly run git status to see what has been updated by you.\n$ git status Great job, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like anything is modified but that\u0026rsquo;s alright we\u0026rsquo;ll change that shortly.\nStep 5: Adding some changes\n$ echo \u0026#39;Hello world! My first git addition\u0026#39; \u0026gt; file.txt $ git status Your git status command should now return some more info telling you there is a new untracked file. Awesome now let\u0026rsquo;s add it.\n$ git add file.txt Step 6: Time to commit, which takes your work and definitively saves it in the project history.\n$ git commit -m \u0026#39;My first commit\u0026#39; # typically you\u0026#39;ll use git-commit without the \u0026#39;-m\u0026#39; flag, but for simplicity this\u0026#39;ll do You\u0026rsquo;ve now contributed to the history of the project, but wait no one will ever know if it\u0026rsquo;s just on your computer.\nStep 7: Time to merge your changes back onto the master branch. Remember this is where everything that is ready and good to go belongs.\n$ git checkout master # switch back to the master branch $ git merge new-branch # merges the changes from new-branch into the master branch Now both branches are equal and have the same history. BTW you can check out the history of the project by running git log.\nStep 8: Always look before you leap, I think that\u0026rsquo;s the saying. Either way it\u0026rsquo;s a good habit to check for any changes made by your peers first before pushing your changes.\n$ git pull Essentially in a nutshell, this command will sync your local copy of the repository with what\u0026rsquo;s in the cloud (or wherever your repo is stored)\nStep 9: Last but certainly not least. For projects/repos you\u0026rsquo;re allowed to make changes to this command will work. If you don\u0026rsquo;t I think it\u0026rsquo;ll fail. You should always check the repositories contributing guidlines to see any rules they may have.\n$ git push # send your changes There you go, you\u0026rsquo;ve essentially just learned the basic git workflow that many people use daily. Honestly you can go far with just knowing these nine (ten if you include git log) commands. It\u0026rsquo;s always recommended that you pick up some more along the way, but definitely get comfortable with these nine since they\u0026rsquo;re the crux of using git, and you\u0026rsquo;ll use them 99% of the time.\n"},{"uri":"https://EthBuilders.github.io/Curriculum/basics/open_source/","title":"Open Source Collaboration","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Before learning about the tools used for Open Source Collaboration, it\u0026rsquo;s best you get an idea of why they exist in the first place, and what exactly open source means. The best place to start when learning about Open Source ofcourse would be the source, pun possibly intended. The Open Source Initiative (a.k.a OSI) is a non-profit corporation which is mission-bound to educate, advocate for, and build bridges within the open source community. The OSI defines what Open Source is very clearly in the OSD (Open Source Definition) as, not just access to source code but also about 9 other criteria.\nBelow are the 10 criteria taken from the OSD:\n Free Redistribution  No restriction of any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution Licensing shall not require a royalty or other fee   Source Code  The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed   Derived Works  The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license   Integrity of The Author\u0026rsquo;s Source Code  The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software Must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code   No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups  Must not discriminate against any person or group of persons   No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor  Must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor   Distribution of License  The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties   License Must Not Be Specific to a Product  The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program\u0026rsquo;s being part of a particular software distribution All parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original software distribution   License Must Not Restrict Other Software  The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software Must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software   License Must Be Technology-Neutral  No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface    Overall, participating in the Open Source ecosystem is quite simple but it is predicated on one simple rule. Always add a license to your work. Adding a license allows others to comfortably contribute/use/modify your project without fear as it protects contributors and users. Businesses and savvy developers won’t touch a project without this protection. Choosing a license isn\u0026rsquo;t that tough either thanks to tools like choosealicense.com, which helps you select a license that fits your project/needs.\nNow, there exists a litany of tools used for open source collaboration, but to start the best thing to learn first is about Source Code Management (SCM) tools. One of the biggest and most well known SCM tools is Git, and its use cases go far beyond just regular software development. It can be applied in many different areas and businesses to simplify collaboration.\n"},{"uri":"https://EthBuilders.github.io/Curriculum/basics/","title":"Basics","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Chapter 1 Development Basics Learn the basics of Markdown, Version Control, JavaScript/NodeJS, and more to kickstart your developer journey.\n"},{"uri":"https://EthBuilders.github.io/Curriculum/basics/git/","title":"Git","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Git VCS Git is a version control system (VCS), in a nutshell, git kind of works like the save functionality in a Microsoft Word document, except git is on steroids. Unlike your regular word document which only keeps a single version of your document (the one which you saved), git keeps the entire history of saves you made to your document/project. And better yet, git allows you to move around in that history like you\u0026rsquo;re a time traveler (if you ever need to be), without much complication. The real benefit to using git however, comes with the fact that it allows you to collaborate efficiently with other people/maintainers/contributors, even though you aren\u0026rsquo;t working at the same time, in the same place, or maybe don\u0026rsquo;t even have access to the internet. Before I get ahead of myself, what is a VCS (version control system)?\n Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.\n- Atlassian\n So onto the nitty-gritty and let\u0026rsquo;s learn some basic git functionality to get you started.\n"},{"uri":"https://EthBuilders.github.io/Curriculum/protocols/","title":"Protocols","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Chapter X Protocols Legend Helpful emojis to let you know status of each section\n   Legend Description     ⚠️ UNDER DEVELOPMENT   👷 IN PROGRESS   🏗️ NEEDS HELP   ✅ DONE    DeFi Stablecoins    Status Topic About     ⚠️ Tether Stablecoin with Fiat US dollar Collateral   ⚠️ USDC Stablecoin with Fiat US dollar Collateral   ⚠️ DAI Decentralized Stablecoin with Crypto Collateral   ⚠️ AmpleForth Algorithmic Decentralized Stablecoin with no Collateral    Exchanges    Status Topic About     ⚠️ UniSwap Automatic market makers and decentralized exchanges   ⚠️ AirSwap Request for Quote and decentralized exchanges    Lending    Status Topic About     ⚠️ Compound Finance Lending Desks and interest generating protocol    Derivatives    Status Topic About     ⚠️ Synthetix Derivatives creation protocol   ⚠️ UMA Another derivatives creation protocol    "},{"uri":"https://EthBuilders.github.io/Curriculum/basics/design_patterns/","title":"Design Patterns","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://EthBuilders.github.io/Curriculum/use_ethereum/","title":"Use Ethereum","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Chapter X Use Ethereum Purpose: Provide the best and easiest to use open source materials to learn how to use Ethereum in-depth.\nWe will provide an overview from the user\u0026rsquo;s perspective.\nGoal: Have 80% of the \u0026ldquo;DeFi\u0026rdquo; by the end of March 2021.\nLegend Helpful emojis to let you know status of each section\n   Legend Description     ⚠️ UNDER DEVELOPMENT   👷 IN PROGRESS   🏗️ NEEDS HELP   ✅ DONE    Learn how to use Ethereum Learn how to interact with the protocols and tools built on Ethereum as a user.\n   Status Topic About     ⚠️ What Is Crypto?

Usually used to create customized mining equipment for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency networks to maximize rewards through increased hash power.   ⚠️ Arbitrage Buying and selling an asset in different markets to profit from the price difference. Buy low in one market, sell at a higher price in another.   ⚠️ ASIC-resistant A cryptocurrency whose procotol mining algorithm is configured to remove any advantage from using ASIC machines when compared to GPU mining. Usually works by inflating the information in RAM taking advantage of the narrow link between memory and CPU. An example can be seen with Monero or Ethereum.   ⚠️ Ask Price The price a seller is willing to accept on their sell order when trading an asset. Also known as the offer price.   ⚠️ Asset Management A system that helps individual or companies manage assets, either for their client or for themselves.   ⚠️ Asynchronous Events in a system that do not happen in linear (synchronous) order, or events that can occur independently of the main process flow.   ⚠️ Atomic Swap An smart contract that allows tokens to be traded peer-to-peer without the need for a trusted third party, usually via escrow contracts and Hash timelock contracts (HCTL). They are atomic because they either are completed or not.   ⚠️ Attack surface Areas in a software environment where an attacker can exploit its system. Successful attacks vectors are called exploits.   ⚠️ Auction A public sale where goods, assets or services are sold to the highest bidder through a bidding process.   👷 Automated Market Maker (AMM) Automated market makers are smart contracts that create a liquidity pool of ERC20 tokens, which are automatically traded by an algorithm rather than an order book. This effectively replaces a traditional limit order-book with a system where assets can be automatically swapped against the pool’s latest price.   There are two main types of automated market makers. One may be governed and set up by professional market makers, and the other is fully automated by an algorithm, allowing any user in the market to participate by depositing liquidity into the smart contract.

Explicitly it is used as a store of value by mimicking the properties of money. It is the first successful attempt at issuing decentralized currency, non-fiat, non-state actor currency which solves the double-spend problem.   👷 Bitcoin core Bitcoin Core consists of both “full-node” software for fully validating the blockchain as well as a bitcoin wallet.   Bitcoin Core is programmed to decide which blockchain contains a valid transaction. Users of Bitcoin Core only accept transactions for that blockchain, making it the Bitcoin blockchain that everyone else to use.     The open-source project maintains and releases Bitcoin client software called “Bitcoin Core”; which is the descendant of the original Bitcoin software client by Satoshi Nakamoto after publishing the Bitcoin whitepaper.          ⚠️ Bitcoin dominance TBD   ⚠️ Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPS) TBD   ⚠️ Blockchain TBD   ⚠️ Block explorer TBD   ⚠️ Block Header TBD   ⚠️ Block Height Number of blocks that have been currently mined since genesis   ⚠️ Block Reward Amount of token reward miners get per block successfully mined   ⚠️ Black swan TBD   ⚠️ Bond TBD   ⚠️ Bot TBD   ⚠️ Bounty TBD   ⚠️ Brute Force Attack TBD   ⚠️ BTD/BTFD (Buy the Fu@*ing Dip) Captitalizing on the price drop of an asset because its fundamentals merits future apperciation in value.   👷 Bull Market A bull market is a term that describes the condition of a financial market in which prices are rising or expected to rise. This term usually refers to the stock market, but can be applied to anything traded. Included are bonds, real estate, commodities, and cryptocurrencies.   Since prices continuously rise and fall during trading, the classification of \u0026ldquo;bull market\u0026rdquo; is reserved for extended amounts of time where a large portion of prices are rising.     👷 Bull Trap A bull trap is a signal that proves to be false by indicating that a decreasing trend in a stock or index has reversed and is starting upward. However, the trend continues going down. Traders acting on this buy signal can be trapped and generate losses on long positions.   ⚠️ BUIDL TBD   ⚠️ Bull Market TBD    C    Legend Term Description     ⚠️ Candlestick Chart (Technical Analysis) TBD   ⚠️ Candidate Block TBD   ⚠️ Capitulation TBD   ⚠️ Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) TBD   ⚠️ Censorship-resistance TBD   ⚠️ Centralization TBD   ⚠️ Central Bank TBD   ⚠️ Central Processing Unit TBD   ⚠️ Centralized TBD   ⚠️ Cipher TBD   ⚠️ Circulating Supply TBD   ⚠️ Cloud TBD   ⚠️ Coin TBD   ⚠️ Coinbase (Bitcoin) The transaction that rewards a miner with the block reward and any transaction fees for their work on the Bitcoin network.   ⚠️ Colocation TBD   ⚠️ Collateral TBD   ⚠️ Commodity Futures Trading Commission TBD   ⚠️ Commit TBD   ⚠️ Confluence TBD   ⚠️ Confirmation TBD   ⚠️ Consumer Price Index (CPI) TBD   ⚠️ Consensus TBD   ⚠️ Contract Address TBD   ⚠️ Commodity Futures Trading Commission TBD   ⚠️ Credentials TBD   ⚠️ Cold Wallet Wallet kept completely offline.

DAO\u0026rsquo;s are open source code operated entirely by its community. The underlying structure and working mechanisms of a DAO aren\u0026rsquo;t based on any kind of hierarchical management. No single entity is in charge, nor any directory board and, no centralization of power. DAOs are conducted by smart contracts that are governed by the collective work of its contributors and community members by enabling the creation of a more efficient system reducing the need for human input, overall costs, and risk related to human behavior.

Typically, a miner will announce a block as soon as they find it. If the block is confirmed, they get a reward for the block.   The goal of shelfish mining is to remain at least one block ahead of the network. Nodes accept the chain with the most accumulated proof of work as a valid blockchain. Anytime, the selfish miner can reveal their chain is longer than the one followed by the rest of the network, the existing blocks are discarded and the transaction becomes reversed. The miner then collects the reward and cause other parties to waste their resources.     ⚠️ Sell Wall TBD   ⚠️ Sentiment TBD   ⚠️ Sharpe Ratio TBD   ⚠️ Smart Contract TBD   ⚠️ Snapshot TBD   ⚠️ Snapshot (Tool) TBD   ⚠️ Source Code TBD   ⚠️ Stablecoin TBD   ⚠️ Staking TBD   ⚠️ Staking Pool TBD   ⚠️ State Channel TBD   ⚠️ Store of Value TBD   ⚠️ Supply Chain TBD   ⚠️ Support (Technical Analysis) TBD    T    Legend Term Description     ⚠️ Taker TBD   ⚠️ Tank TBD   ⚠️ Ticker TBD   ⚠️ Token TBD   ⚠️ Token Lockup TBD   ⚠️ Token Sale TBD   ⚠️ Total Supply TBD   ⚠️ Transaction ID (TXID) TBD   ⚠️ Transaction Hash TBD   ⚠️ Transaction Hash TBD   ⚠️ Transactions Per Section (TPS) TBD   ⚠️ Trustless TBD   ⚠️ Turing Complete TBD    U    Legend Term Description     ⚠️ Unit of Account TBD   ⚠️ User Experience (UX) TBD   ⚠️ User Interface (UI) TBD   ⚠️ Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) TBD    V    Legend Term Description     ⚠️ Venture Capital TBD   ⚠️ Virtual Machine TBD   ⚠️ Volatility TBD   ⚠️ Volume TBD    W    Legend Term Description     ⚠️ Wallet TBD   ⚠️ Weak Hands TBD   ⚠️ Weak Subjectivity TBD   ⚠️ Web 1.0 TBD   ⚠️ Web 2.0 TBD   ⚠️ Web 3.0 TBD   ⚠️ Wei TBD   ⚠️ Whale TBD   ⚠️ Whiskers TBD   ⚠️ Whitelist TBD   ⚠️ Wrapped Ether (WETH) TBD   ⚠️ Wick (Technical Analysis) TBD    X    Legend Term Description     ⚠️ XML (Extensible Markup Language) TBD    Y    Legend Term Description     ⚠️ Yearn Finance TBD   ⚠️ Yield TBD   ⚠️ Yield Farming TBD    Z    Legend Term Description     ⚠️ Zero-Knowledge Proofs TBD   ⚠️ ZK-Snarks TBD    Special Symbols    Legend Term Description     ⚠️ !
